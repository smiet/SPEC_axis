Adelle, 

The files profiles-g and profiles-p contain information on the 
qsolv equilibrium. 
I have labelled the columns, and provided a python program that 
reads one of the files. 
You could easily adapt this, or copy-paste the content into ipython, 
and then you have the variables Psi, p and ppxx to work with. 

Further information:
