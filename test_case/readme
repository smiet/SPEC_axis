!!!! Comments about SPEC !!!!

The SPEC solution is controlled largely by the flags LBeltrami and LConstraint.

LBeltrami flag gives the numercial method which SPEC uses to solve for the Beltrami field in each region.
Some (as of yet) undocumented perculiarities;

1.) If LBeltrami=2 (Newton Method) then SPEC overwrites user input for LConstraint and sets LConstraint=2 (conserved helicity). This can be seen in the .sp.end ouput and presumably means the system is solved according to LConstaint=2 (but this should be verified). Why this happens is probably related to the implementation of the Newton Method. Need to look through the source code.

This may be problematic for some studies because the Newton Method finds extrema whereas I believe other methods (SQP and linear) will only find minima (in principle).

mtor270519: 2-volume test case (picked some arbitrary values for pressure and q). Solution doesn't seem correct; not converged.

mtor010619: Iteration of mtor270519 to test different solution settings and attempt get converged solution.
	    Using LBeltrami=4 (linear method) and LConstraint=1 (rotational transform constraint).
	    With 0 pressure (pscale=0).

mtor010619b: Correctly set up prescription of the interface positions.
	     Note that specifying the interface position is only necessary if Linitialize=-1 or 0.
	     In this case, this is specified by a list at the end of the .sp input file.
	     By checking the .sp.end output we can verify that SPEC is indeed adjusting the position of the interfaces to find the minimum energy solution.

N2_020619a,b: 2-volume unperturbed calculation using NOVA equilibrium profiles.
	      Tried calculating R-coordinate of interface using formula for LInitialize=1. 
	      Since toroidal fluxes are given, may not need to use LIinitialize=0? (Could possibly just use flux co-ordinates).
	      Between a and b some parameters changed to improve convergence.
	      Poicare section and q-profile can be found in .jpeg file.

N2_020619c: Same as b but tested a small m=3, n=3 boundary perturbation.
	    Poincare section and q-profile can be found in .jpeg file.

N4_020619a: 4-volume unperturbed calculation using NOVA equilibrium profiles.
	    Interface geometry specified as N2 cases.
	    Solution not converged yet, need to work on this.

!!!! Prescribing interface geometry in SPEC !!!!

As a supplement to the online documentation, here is how the SPEC interface geometry is specified:

User input of interface geometry is given at the end of .sp, after:

&screenlist
.

.
/
[INTERFACE GEOMETRY]

The geometry is given in column and row format, without any headers.
The corresponding entries are explained in the following table:

For l=1,...,N interfaces:

m | n | R(m,n) of l=1 interface | Z(m,n) of l=1 interface | Zero | Zero | ...... | R(m,n) of l=N interface (outer boundary) | Z(m,n) of l=N interface (outer boundary)| Zero | Zero
===================================================================================================================================================================================
0 | 0 |    Rac                  |      0                  |   0  |  0   | ...... |      Rbc(0,0)                            |     0                                   |   0  |  0

up to arbitrary m and n as required. 


* Here, the components of R and Z are like x and y co-ordinates for a closed curve such that R=major radiaus and Z=minor radius. E.g. a circle centred at Rbc(0,0) would have radius R(1,0)=Z(1,0).
Additional components of the Fourier expansion may be given as required. 


* Note that compared to specification of the Fourier components in &physicslist the order of m and n is reversed. E.g. Rbc(n,m) in &physicslist becomes Rbc(m,n) in interface geometry.
