!!!! Comments about SPEC !!!!

The SPEC solution is controlled largely by the flags LBeltrami and LConstraint.

LBeltrami flag gives the numercial method which SPEC uses to solve for the Beltrami field in each region.
Some (as of yet) undocumented perculiarities;

1.) If LBeltrami=2 (Newton Method) then SPEC overwrites user input for LConstraint and sets LConstraint=2 (conserved helicity). This can be seen in the .sp.end ouput and presumably means the system is solved according to LConstaint=2 (but this should be verified). Why this happens is probably related to the implementation of the Newton Method. Need to look through the source code.

This may be problematic for some studies because the Newton Method finds extrema whereas I believe other methods (SQP and linear) will only find minima (in principle).

mtor270519: 2-volume test case (pciked some arbitrary values for pressure and q). Solution doesn't seem correct; not converged.

mtor010619: Iteration of mtor270519 to test different solutions settings and attempt get converged solution.
	    Using LBeltrami=4 (linear method) and LConstraint=1 (rotational transform constraint). With 0 pressure (pscale=0).
